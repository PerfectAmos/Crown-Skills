              Entrepreneurship is an important driving factor for economic
              growth and employment. It holds even greater importance in
              developing countries, significantly enhancing socio-economic
              growth. Small and medium-sized enterprises not only create
              employment opportunities but also contribute 50 to 70% of GDP.
              Crown Institute provides entrepreneurship promotion services,
              supporting every stage from idea generation to inception and
              through to successful implementation. We connect experts with
              entrepreneurs and facilitate business-to-business interactions to
              promote the entire entrepreneurship ecosystem.
